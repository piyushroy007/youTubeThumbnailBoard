# youTubeThumbnailBoard
the Idea is to build a thumbnail board for all Youtubers in which they can paste any YOUTUBE video's link and the thumbnail would automatically be added in a database and then it can be shared as a link to the designer. This problem is actually a painkiller for all youtubers who are always looking for inspiration for thumbnails
